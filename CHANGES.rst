Changes
=======

2.0 (2022-12-05)
----------------

- Fix parsing of ``builders`` and ``display_renderers`` in custom parts.
  [rnix]

- Fix signature of ``yafowil.yaml.tests.test_vocab``. Property callbacks always
  gets passed ``widget`` and ``data`` as of yafowil 3.0.0.
  [rnix]

- Parse values of attributes (data-Attributes) if type() is dict.
  HTML5 Data-Attributes with i18n or callables are possible now.
  [2silver]

**Breaking changes:**

- Add ``python:`` expressions. Needed for cases where property callbacks not
  accept ``widget`` and ``data`` keyword arguments, e.g. ``datatype``. This is
  necessary because ``callable_value`` function in yafowil 3.0 no longer calls
  callable without arguments as fallback.
  [rnix]


1.3.1 (2020-07-09)
------------------

- Pass ``yaml.SafeLoader`` loader to ``yaml.load`` to prevent arbitrary code
  execution.
  [rnix]

- Cleanup.

1.3 (2018-07-16)

- Convert doctests to unittests.

1.2 (2014-11-13)
